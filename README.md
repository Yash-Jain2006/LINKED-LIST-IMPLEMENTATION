*NAME*: YASH JAIN

*INTERN_ID*: CT06DG3399

*DOMAIN*: C PROGRAMMING

*DURATON*: 6 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Linked List (LL)** in the C programming language.The program supports:
- Insertion at the beginning, end, or at a specific position  
- Deletion from the beginning, end, or a specific position  
- Traversal and display of list contents
  
Singly Linked Lists are a fundamental **data structure** in computer science, widely used for dynamic memory allocation, stack/queue design, and efficient memory handling.


##  Features
- Insert node at the **beginning** of the list
- Insert node at the **end** of the list
- Insert node at a **specific position**
- Delete node from the **beginning**
- Delete node from the **end**
- Delete node from a **specific position**
- **Traverse & Display** the entire linked list

## Core Functions:
- insertAtBeginning(int data)
- insertAtEnd(int data)
- insertAtPosition(int data, int pos)
- deleteFromBeginning()
- deleteFromEnd()
- deleteFromPosition(int pos)
- displayList()


## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C  
- **Compiler:** GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- **Editor/IDE:**  
  - Visual Studio Code  
  - Code::Blocks  
- **Operating System:** Windows


## Summary
The program uses a **struct Node** containing data and a pointer next.
Nodes are dynamically created using malloc() ensuring efficient memory allocation.
**Insertion** and **Deletion** functions handle edge cases (empty list, invalid positions).
**Traversal** prints the current list state, showing the NULL termination.
This project serves as a learning resource for beginners to understand dynamic data structures in C.
